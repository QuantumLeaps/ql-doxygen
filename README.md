# About QL-Doxygen

QL-Doxygen is a Doxygen customization based on
[doxygen-awesome-css](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css).

The goal of QL-Doxygen is to udpate the styling of the Doxgygen documentation
in HTML to the more modern look.

Besides this, QL-Doxygen contains common elements for Quantum Leaps
documentation, such as headers, footers, parts of the Doxyfle, as well as
the repeated parts of the documentation in various software components
provided by Quantum Leaps.
